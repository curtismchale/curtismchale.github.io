I love me some [VVV](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV), it's been
my default development environment for a while.

Recently while trying to test some emails from WooCommerce Bookings I had to dig
through the VVV documentation to find where you can actually locate the
[MailCatcher](https://mailcatcher.me/) instance since it's not at the default
port.

If you're using VVV and want to find MailCatcher use: [vvv.dev:1080/](http://vvv.dev:1080/)
