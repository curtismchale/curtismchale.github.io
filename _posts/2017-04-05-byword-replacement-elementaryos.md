Coming to Elementary OS from OSX means that you must give up many of the great Markdown editors available for Apple's platform.  Applications like Byword and AI Writer simply don't run on the Linux platform.

After a decent amount of searching I've settled on [ghostwriter](https://wereturtle.github.io/ghostwriter/). It has decent HTML preview of your posts. I can export in to multiple formats. I specifically wanted to be able to copy/paste an HTML version of a markdown post so that I can paste it in to WordPress and have others work on my content in editing. Training them to use Mardown proved to be a pain and since I don't need to dive in regularly in the WordPress editor it was fine with me to let them use the visual view.

Other options were:

- [Haroopad](http://pad.haroopress.com/) (just didn't do the exporting I liked and no distraction free)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) (again exporting though it's still a good option and it is my code editor of choice)

There were a number of others I found mentioned but either their sites were dead or I couldn't get them installed in Elementary OS. They never even got a try due to those problems.
