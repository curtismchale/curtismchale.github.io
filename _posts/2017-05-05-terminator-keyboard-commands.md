title: Splitting Terminator and Terminator keyboard commands

Back on macOS I was an avid [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) user which doesn't exist on Linux, but there
are options.

I've settled on
[Terminator](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.ca/p/introduction.html) because it
deals with splits in much the same way as iTerm2 did. Still, there is little UI
on Terminator which means that the keyboard commands to split your terminal, or
do anything else from the keyboard aren't obvious.

- `F11` - toggles fullscreen
- `Ctrl + Shift + O` - split terminals horizontally
- `Ctrl + Shift + E` - split terminals vertically
- `Ctrl + Shift + W` - close current panel
- `Ctrl + Shift + T` - open new tab
- `Alt + Arrow Up/Down/Left/Right` - move to the terminal above/below/left/right
  of the current terminal

If you're looking for more of what Terminator has to offer, right click on the
Terminator window and from the menu you can access the preferences.
