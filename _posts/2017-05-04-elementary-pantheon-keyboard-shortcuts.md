Coming from MacOS I was a long time user of [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/). It just worked like I expected which meant that switching to ElementaryOS presented a few issues.

First, changing between tabs in the terminal was no longer my expected Control + ]. With some guessing the only thing I could make happen was using the CTRL key in combination with a number to select the tab with the matching number.

So you don't have that same issue, here are the defualt keyboard commands for Pantheon Terminal in ElementaryOS.

`Ctrl + D` - closes the active tab

`Ctrl + Shift + W` - closes tab

`Ctrl + Shift + T` - opens a new tab

`Ctrl + Shift + N` - open a new window

`Ctrl + Shift + F` - open a search field

`Ctrl + Shift + A` - select all text

`Ctrl + Shift + Right Arrow` - next tab

`Ctrl + Shift + Left Arrow` - previous tab

`Alt + <1-9>` - jumps to the tab of the corresponding number

`Ctrl + Plus` - increases the font size

`Ctrl + Minus` - decreases the font size

Now to see if I install zsh instead of bash, which is what I had on MacOS. Guess I'll have to dig in and see since previously I simply trusted a friend and made the change.
